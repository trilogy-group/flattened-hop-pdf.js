# PDF.js

[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.

PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.

In this fork, we are styling the menu and we are also adding dark mode button to toolbar and removing edit, annotations and load buttons.

run `gulp minified-legacy` or `gulp generic-legacy` to generate the viewer.html file and all the dependencies.
